# WeatherApp
<h3>Summary</h3>
<strong>General overview</strong>: Basic HTML/CSS website providing weather data, using Flask framework

I used a Flask framework to create a simple website, linking main Python code and HTML. User input through the use of HTML forms was retrieved and sent to the main code.
Weather data was retrieved by using <em>OpenWeatherAPI</em> based on the information the user inputted into the form. Basic HTML/CSS was used to format the webpage.

I already had a foundation in Python prior to this, so this was less about learning Python and more about learning how to use APIs and integrating Python with HTML through Flask to create a basic useable website.

<strong>Skills learned for this project</strong>: APIs, Flask framework, HTML/CSS
